# Catapult :red_circle:

![Catapult simulation](../media/catapult.png?raw=true)

I did this project in the 1st half of 2020, the goal is to simulate a catapult using the Java language and the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) framework, to make that I used a [tutorial](https://github.com/Pixmeg/Catapult) from PixMeg.
